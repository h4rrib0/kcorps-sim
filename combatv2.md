Damage Types:
Impact (Force): 
Impact force directly applied, reduced by a flat value of target Mass / 2. Also chance to daze/down the target. The chance to inflict a Wound is Force/Armor. If force exceeds armor, you get one guaranteed wound, and then (Force-Armor)/Armor chance to apply another.

Bladed (Edge, Power, Precision):
Bladed weapons must roll to overcome armor. First check for a critical hit. If (Attack Success Margin) + Precision > Armor - Wounds, the weapon slips through a joint or a crack, lodging itself deep in the vulnerable interior of the enemy. This attack deals double damage.

If not, check if (Attack Success Margin) + Power > Armor - Wounds. If successful, apply the full edge damage to the enemy target, inflict an additional Wound, and roll on the penetrating damage table. Otherwise, the attack glances off.

Finally, apply Power as Impact damage.

Ballistic (Penetration):
Inflict Penetration damage reduced by Armor/2. Also roll on the penetrating damage table once for every point that Penetration exceeds Armor.

Additional Changes:
Agility and Precision now cap out at pilot Preservation and Aggression respectively. (Will need to tweak numbers).

Attack roll is now 1d6 + Precision vs defender Agility + Difficulty
Also apply relevant modifiers
(So basically, at parity precision/agility, it's 1d6 > difficulty). 1d6 Creates less harsh break points over 2d6.

Grapple roll is opposed 2*Mass + Agility + 1d6.
