# Segment and Subsystem Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented the segment and subsystem systems as planned. This enhancement brings more tactical depth to the combat system by allowing for targeted attacks on specific parts of a unit and subsystem damage that can cripple key functionality.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Data Model
- Created `Segment` and `Subsystem` interfaces in `models.ts`
- Added segment targeting to `GameState`
- Defined segment types (HEAD, TORSO, etc.) and subsystem types (WEAPON, SENSOR, etc.)

### 2. State Management
- Added segment-related actions to `actions.ts`
- Created a new `segmentReducers.ts` file with reducers for adding, removing, and damaging segments/subsystems
- Updated the main combat reducer to support segment targeting and damage

### 3. UI Components
- Added `SegmentPanel.tsx` for targeting specific segments during combat
- Updated `AttackPanel.tsx` to include segment targeting button
- Enhanced `DetailsPanel.tsx` to show segment and subsystem details
- Created `SegmentDetails.tsx` for showing detailed information about a segment and its subsystems

### 4. Utility Functions
- Created `segmentUtils.ts` with helper functions for generating default segments and subsystems
- Added functions to calculate total durability from segments

## Combat System Changes
- Modified damage calculation to account for segment-specific armor
- Added segment targeting during attacks
- Implemented subsystem failure when segment durability falls below a threshold
- Weapon subsystems can now be damaged, rendering weapons inoperable

## User Experience Improvements
- Added visual indicators for targeted segments
- Added status indicators for subsystem functionality
- Enhanced unit details to show segment health and subsystem status
- Provide options to target specific segments for tactical gameplay

## Future Enhancements
1. Add repair mechanics for segments and subsystems
2. Implement special moves that target or affect specific segments
3. Add critical hit mechanics for additional subsystem damage chance
4. Expand the variety of subsystems with unique effects
5. Add visual damage indicators on the unit representations

## Technical Details
The implementation follows the established patterns in the codebase:
- Types and interfaces maintain consistent naming and structure
- Reducer functions follow the same pure function approach
- UI components maintain consistent styling and user interaction patterns

This enhancement significantly increases the tactical depth of the combat system while maintaining the existing gameplay flow.
